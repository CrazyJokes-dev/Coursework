<summary>Node.js</summary>
<p>This framework uses JavaScript as the language and is very event-driven. <br>
	Another good thing is that node.js outputs the data in chunks so there isn't really any buffering for data. <br>
	We also decided to use Node.js for our big project as well so that's also pretty nice.
